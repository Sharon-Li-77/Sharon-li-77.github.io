        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The best thing I learnt during myself is I need to take break and seek
        for help when I get stuck more than 30 min.And also be nice and kind to
        yourself when suffering.

      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        They are play an importance role in programming. Selt-awareness is the
        ability to understand and yourself and empathy is the ability to feel
        the same as other. In the process of learning and programming, having a
        good self-awareness can help us to treat ourselves well when suffering.
        And empathy can allow us to have a better communication with others, and
        feel what other people felt, such as offering help when other suffering.

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        I have so surprised there are so many emotional aspects that can affect
        our learning journey.

    <div class="black-four">
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most challenging aspect of core learning is that I need to
        think in my brain for long time and spend more time online to get to
        know the contents of core leaning each week. Becuase this kind of topic
        is quite a new topic for me.

      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Becuase employeies are more care about the those non-technical skill.
        And tech changes very fast, it is imposisble for us to learn all the
        tech skill. The non-tech skill is more important aspect for employer to
        look at

      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Yes, at the beginning of the course,I did not put much attention on the
        core leaning content. However, after sprint 2, I noticed that the
        content of core learning was actually happening everyday. And I started
        to spend times to learn the core learning and try to refelect it in my
        previous studting journay, which helped me to have a better understand
        of myself in a deeper level.
