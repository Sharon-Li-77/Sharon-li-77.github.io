    <p>
      In this article, we will discuss inline-block elements property. It is a
      very useful property of CSS. We can apply it to various tags. It is a part
      of the CSS display property.

    The elements that do not begin on a new line are known as inline elements.
    They are combined as a part of the main text and not a separate action.
    These elements occupy only the required space. Spaces to the left and right
    can be added to an inline element, but there cannot be added height to the
    top or bottom padding or margin of an inline element.

      The display value of inline-block works similarly to inline with one
      exception: the height and width of that element become modifiable.
