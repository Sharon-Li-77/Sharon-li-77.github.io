        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how

        There were a time, a checkout staff at countdown gave me extra $10
        changes. Being honest is very importance in my ethics, I decided to give
        the $10 back to the staff. Now I feel proud of myself doing the right
        things.

      <li>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </li>

      <p>
        My frind and family are always honest to others. The people you choose
        to associate with always tell others something about you. My friends and
        family always affect me in a postive way.

      <li>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </li>

      <p>
        My limitations is lack of patience. I can loss my patience easily when I
        get stuck. It can affect the outcome of my study becuase it will slow
        down my learning process
      </p>

      <li>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </li>

      <p>
        I had a groupwork in my last year of university.However, my process was
        very slow due to the high tension of my part. The strategy I used was to
        seperate the big projct into different small parts and get them solved
        step by step. This strategy helped me to work very effectively
        eventhough it took longer time to complete the work. Other strategy I
        would try now is seeking help from peers and ask for relocation for the
        work. Because high tension work can slow down the whole process. In
        order to finish the work in time, I would take the part which I good at.
