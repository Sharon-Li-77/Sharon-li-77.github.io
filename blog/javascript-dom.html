    <h1>Javascript & relationship between HTML and CSS</h1>

    <p>
      Javascript, HTML and CSS are the basic three languages for building a
      website. For example, HTML is the skeletion of a house, CSS is the color/
      deisgn of a house. Javascript is to execute the function inside the house
      for exaple: turn on the light in the night time.

    <h1>control flow</h1>

    <p>
      Control flow is the order in which the computer run the codes from the top
      to the bottom. However., there are some structures whihc can change the
      order the code such as conditionals and loops. Control flow is like the
      daily rountine of our daily life. Loop and conditions are like the
      breakfast in our daily life, we cant move to lunctime untill we finish the
      breakfast.
    </p>

    <h1>Conditionals</h1>

    <p>
      Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine
      whether or not pieces of code can run. There are multiple different types
      of conditionals in JavaScript including: “If” statements: where if a
      condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.
      “Else” statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the
      execution for a block of code. “Else if” statements: this specifies a new
      test if the first condition is false. For example:
    </p>

    <h1>Loop</h1>

    <p>
      Loops are iteration statements that will keep running until there is
      either nothing left to loop over, or if the condition becomes false.Such
      as: "For" loop. The for is a conditional loop, which means that it runs
      based on if a certain condition is true. As long as it stays true, the
      code is going to keep executing.Such as For loop, While lopp and
      Do-while-loop. An example of For loop as shown below:
    </p>
    <img src="../images/for-loop.png" alt="for-loop-example" class="image" />

    <h1>DOM</h1>
    <p>
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
      documents.The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a
      Web API used to build websites. JavaScript can also be used in other
      contexts.For example, if I want to interface the <"h1"> element in HTML
      file. I can run "document.querySelector(h1)" in Javascript
    </p>
    <h1>Objects & Array</h1>
    <p>
      Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to
      store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). Arrays are a
      special type of variable that is also mutable and can also be used to
      store a list of values.
    </p>

    <h1>Powerful Function!</h1>
    <p>
      A function is almost like a mini-program that we can write separately from
      the main program, without having to think about the rest of the program
      while we write it. This allows us to reduce a complicated program into
      smaller, more manageable chunks, which reduces the overall complexity of
      our program
