      <h1>Neuroscientists</h1>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is a broad term that refers to the brain’s ability to
        change, adapt and modify its structure and function throughout life and
        in response to experience. When people say that the brain is plastic,
        they don’t mean that the brain is analogous to plastic. Plasticity
        refers to the brain’s malleability, described as the ability to be
        “easily influenced, trained or controlled”. Neuro refers to neurons,
        which are the building blocks of the brain and nervous system.
        Neuroplasticity is defined as the ability of neurons to change or adapt

      <h1>How can we use neuroscience in Learning?</h1>
      <p>
        It shouldn’t come as a surprise that people enjoy receiving rewards. For
        some tasks we need a reward to stay motivated. According to
        neuroscientists, it’s believed that when it comes to a reward, dopamine
        levels rise in our brain. This dopamine increases eagerness and keeps
        online learners interested. In addition, it motivates them to fully
        participate in the hunt for the grand prize. Earning a badge or
        levelling up can serve as a simple motivator. Because of this, many
        eLearning professionals are converting their courses into gamification
        courses. To make learning more interesting, gamification integrates
        elements of games, such as leader boards and scoring systems, into
        traditional learning materials.

        brain is often compared to a machine. Machines, on the other hand,
        aren’t constrained by emotions such as fear, worry, or similar issues.
        Our brain therefore needs an optimal learning environment in order to
        fully absorb information. In fact, two essential actions are required:
        The brain’s ability to process input comes first. In addition, new
        neurons and pathways must develop. These procedures can be disrupted,
        which limits the storage of information. eLearning professionals
        therefore need to create an optimal learning environment. These include
        colour schemes, soothing music, and artistic components. The level of
        difficulty can also affect the brain’s ability to process information

      <h1>Two ways to improve Neuroplasticity:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Keep learning and moving</h3></li>
        <p>
          Keep learning and moving. Learning a new language, musical instrument,
          or type of dance can help make your brain stronger. Exercise itself
          boosts oxygen supply to the brain to increase brain volume
        </p>

        <li><h3>Practice meditation</h3></li>
        <p>
          long-term meditatiob practice can change the function of the brain.

      <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
      <p>
        Growth mindset describes a way of viewing challenges and setbacks.
        People who have a growth mindset believe that even if they struggle with
        certain skills, their abilities aren't set in stone. They think that
        with work, their skills can improve over time,
      </p>

        The connections between neurons in our brain can change as we grow and
        gain experience. These new connections not only add to the neural
        networks but also speed up the transmission of electrical signals in the
        brain
      </p>

      <p>
        The topic of grwoth mindset surprise me a lot. The power of believing
        you can improve is a very great power. We can grow our brain's capacity
        to learn and solve problems wit the growth mindset by rewarding.Rewards
        that can make us feel good about the present moment, which are release
        of neurotransmitters.The dopamine reward system which is secreted
        en-route to rewards. Introducing dopamine rewards in small doses, while
        pursuing a goal, and then claim a high reward when you reach your goal,
        you will form neural plasticity to reinforces the action reward circuit.
        In the learning journey,I will use the power of believe I can improve.
        When I meet chanllenges, I will treat this as opportunities to learn new
        knowledge and grow.
