    <h1>Problem-solving skill</h1>
    <p style="padding-left:300px;padding-right:300px;" >
      Problem solving is a critical skill for any software developer. In a
      constantly changing industry, developers are faced with complex problems
      and challenges on a daily basis. Without the ability to solve problems
      effectively, developers can quickly become stuck and fail to deliver
      results
    </p>
    <h1>Problem-solving techniques:</h1>

    <div class="box">
    <ul>
      <li class="A">Pseudocode</li>
      <p style="text-align:center;":>
        We use pseudocode in various fields of programming, whether it be app
        development, data science or web development. Pseudocode is a technique
        used to describe the distinct steps of an algorithm in a manner that’s
        easy to understand for anyone with basic programming knowledge. Although
        pseudocode is a syntax-free description of an algorithm, it must provide
        a full description of the algorithm’s logic so that moving from
        pseudocode to implementation is merely a task of translating each line
        into code using the syntax of any given programming language.

      <h3 >How to write Pseudocode</h2>
      <ol class="B">
        <li>Always capitalize the initial word (often one of the main six constructs).</li>
        <li>Make only one statement per line.</li>
        <li>Indent to show hierarchy, improve readability, and show nested constructs.</li>
        <li>Always end multi-line sections using any of the END keywords (ENDIF, ENDWHILE, etc.).</li>
        <li> Keep your statements programming language independent.</li>
        <li>Use the naming domain of the problem, not that of the implementation. For instance: “Append the last name to the first name” instead of “name = first+ last."</li>
        <li>Keep it simple, concise and readable.</li>

      <li class="A"> Analysing the Problem</li>
      <p>Every problem has a perfect solution; before we are ready to solve a problem, we must look over the question and understand it. When we know the question, it is easy to find the solution for it. If we are not ready with what we have to solve, then we end up with the question and cannot find the answer as expected. By analysing it, we can figure out the outputs and inputs to be carried out. Thus, when we analyse and are ready with the list, it is easy and helps us find the solution easily. </p>
        
      <li class="A">Splitting complex goals into simpler ones </li>
      <p>Every large and complex task can be divided into smaller and more comfortable assignments. The ability to break work into smaller tasks is often natural to huamns and an essentital skill to help get most things or service done.</p>
      <li class="A">Testing and Debugging</li>
      <p>The designed and developed program undergoes several rigorous tests based on various real-time parameters and the program undergoes various levels of simulations. It must meet the user's requirements, which have to respond with the required time. It should generate all expected outputs to all the possible inputs. The program should also undergo bug fixing and all possible exception handling. If it fails to show the possible results, it should be checked for logical errors.</p>
